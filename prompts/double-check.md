Double check the code you've written:
- Will it compile?
- Is it properly commented?
- Does it meet the requirements I stated?

Pull in any additional files you need to verify.

If you find any issues, please modify the appropriate code files to fix them. Remember that you are solely responsible for changing the code, so make all of the necessary changes to files yourself.
